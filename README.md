## Overview
This Project is to interpret Data for our client, Computing Vision, to create the best movie possible. We'll clean and interpret data, create visualizations, and perform statistical analysis to give a few reccomendations on how to create a successful movie.

## Business Understanding

We are working for a company called Computing Vision which wants to create a new movie studio. We need to explore characteristics that movies currently performing well in the box office have. Then, we'll create analysis from our data exploration and give Computing Vision reccomendations on the best approach to creating a successful movie.

## Data Understanding and Analysis

We used data from publicly available websites storing information about movies. We used IMDB, TN, BOM, and TMDB.

The data from these databases includes movie titles, release date, ratings, production cost, gross revenue domestic and worldwide, language, movie genre, actors, actresses, directors, producers, and writers.

For our analysis, we chose gross profit (worldwide gross revenue - production budget) as the best indicator of a movie's success. It's a pretty simple metric, where more money = more success.

As far as movie characteristics go we first filtered out non-english movies, since our client's new movie studio is based in America. We investigated release dates, ratings, movie genre, runtime, and cast/production crew to look for factors that were present in good movies. The best characteristics that we were able to differentiate were runtime, genre, and release date.

We found that longer movies tended to create more profit than shorter movies.

We found that the most successful genre was Action.

We found that movies released in warmer months (Spring and Summer) performed better than movies released in colder months (Fall and Winter)

## Statistical Communication
To solidify our results, we ran statistical analysis on our data for both shorter vs longer movies as well as for warm release dates vs cold release dates.
